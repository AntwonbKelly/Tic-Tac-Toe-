# How To  Play

Each player must choose a row, as well as a space within that row. Once a player gets three in a row vertically, diagonally, or horizontally.

Player one starts first, then player 2, and so on.

Player1's marks are represented by X.


Player2's marks are represented by O.

The script will end if both players tie, or one player manages to win.
